This project is a solution to a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The software allows the user to input the puzzle, solve it, and clear the grid easily.
The application uses Tkinter for the graphical interface, allowing the user to manually enter the numbers and solve the puzzle with ease.

Enter numbers in the Sudoku grid. If the numbers are invalid (not between 1 and 9), an error message will appear.
You can use the Solve button to solve the puzzle automatically.
Use the Clear button to reset the grid and start over.
